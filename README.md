  - Website : https://demowebshop.tricentis.com/
  - Created Scenarios & Test Cases :
      -  Register Success
      -  Register Failed already Registered
      -  Login Success
      -  Login Failed Wrong Email
      -  Login Failed Empty Email
      -  Add to Cart Product
      -  Checkout Product
  - Notes : For the "Register Success" function can only be run once, if you run that code more than one, the "Register Success" is failed              because the email is registered before at your first run. you can run it again by change the code on email part. thankyouu
